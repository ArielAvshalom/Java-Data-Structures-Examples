# Java Data Structures Examples
 Examples of Java Data Structures for my CISC 3130 Course

The first example here is from February 11th, 2021. Here we created a class and an object of that class. This is located in "\Headphone Example" and can be run by running javac on main.java followed by java on main.

Update: I've been adding more and more examples here as well as solutions to selected homework problems.
