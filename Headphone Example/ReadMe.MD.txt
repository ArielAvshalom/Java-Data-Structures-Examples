There are 3 files in this folder.
2 files are java files, the Main.java file and the compiled Main.class file. The 3rd file is an equivalent python headphone.py file. Note how much smaller it is. I recommend trying to time the two and seeing how much faster Java as a compiled vs interpreted language is though. This stuff could matter when designing projects that need to be fast.
